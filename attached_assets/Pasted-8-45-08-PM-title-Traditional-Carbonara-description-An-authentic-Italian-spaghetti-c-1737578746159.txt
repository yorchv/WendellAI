  "instructions": [
    "Cut the guanciale into small pieces and cook in a skillet over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. The more it cooks, the more its fat will melt and its meat will become crispy.",
    "In a bowl, beat the eggs with a fork until they are well combined. Add the finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese and mix until you have a creamy sauce. Add freshly ground black pepper to taste.",
    "Boil the water in a large pot. Add salt (depending on the saltiness of your guanciale) and cook the spaghetti until al dente.",
    "Drain the spaghetti when it's ready and set it aside.",
    "In the same skillet used for cooking the guanciale, add the pasta and toss to coat with the melted fat.",
    "Remove the pan from heat. Add the egg and Pecorino Romano cream mixture to the pasta. Stir quickly to avoid scrambling the eggs.",
    "If the sauce seems too runny, add some grated Pecorino Romano. If it's too sticky, add a little cooking water.",
    "Serve immediately, topped with additional grated Pecorino Romano and freshly ground black pepper"
